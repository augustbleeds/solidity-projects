# Solidity Project Repo

This is the repo for some of the solidity projects I've done.

# TL;DR

# crowdfund
A decentralized crowdfunding contract with specific rules that protect both sides of the marketplace and awards NFTs to contributors based on the contribution amount.

# dao
A DAO where members can vote to put forward proposals, vote, and execute arbitrary EVM functions on-chain. I also added a novel proposal cancellation feature which cancel proposals still pending executions.

# ico
An ICO for an ERC-20 meme-coin "space coin" that has 3 stages for private investors, limited contributions, and unlimited contributions up to the total funding amount. SPC has a transfer tax.

# lp (liquidity pool)
A constant-product automated market maker inspired by Uniswapv2. It allows the swapping for ETH to SpaceCoin (the meme-coin I created earlier in another folder).
